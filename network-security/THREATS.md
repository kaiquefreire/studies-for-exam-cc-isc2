# Threats & Attacks

# Types of Threats
| Vulnerability | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| Spoofing | An attack where a malicious actor disguises their identity to gain unauthorized access to a network or system. This can include IP spoofing, ARP spoofing, and email spoofing. |
| Phishing | An attack where a malicious actor sends a fraudulent message, often through email or social media, with the goal of tricking the recipient into giving up sensitive information or installing malware. |
| DOS/DDOS | Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks involve overwhelming a server or network with traffic, making it unable to handle legitimate requests. |
| Virus | A type of malware that infects a system. Viruses can damage or destroy data, and can spread to other systems through infected files. |
| Worm | Similar to a virus, a worm is a self-replicating malware that can spread across a network without the need for a host file or program. |
| Trojan | A type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate program in order to trick users into installing it. Trojans can be used to steal data, install additional malware, or take control of a system. |
| On-path attack | An attack where a malicious actor intercepts and modifies network traffic between two systems. This can include Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks or Session Hijacking. |
| Side-channel | An attack where a malicious actor exploits weaknesses in a system's physical properties, such as power consumption or electromagnetic radiation, to extract sensitive information. |
| Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) | A targeted attack where a malicious actor gains persistent access to a network or system, often through spear-phishing or other social engineering tactics. APTs can be used for espionage, data theft, or sabotage. |
| Insider | An attack where a trusted individual with access to a system or network abuses that access for personal gain or to cause harm. |
| Malware | A broad term for any type of malicious software, including viruses, worms, trojans, and other types of malicious code. |
| Ransomware | A type of malware that encrypts a user's files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key. Ransomware can be distributed through email, malicious websites, or other means. |
