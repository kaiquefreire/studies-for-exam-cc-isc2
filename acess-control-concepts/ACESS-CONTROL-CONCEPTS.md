| Object             | Refers to the resource being protected                        |
| Rules              | Are rules that specify how subjects can access objects and what they can do with them. Rules may be based on specific security policies and restrictions. |

## Reviewing
We will talk about the types of acess controls: Physical, Logical and Administrative. So, let's review this concepts:

| Layer               | Description                                                  | Real-world analogy |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Physical Controls   | Refers to tangible security measures, such as gates, fences, security cameras, and locks. | A locked door or a fence around a property |
| Logical/Technical Controls | Refers to technical measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access controls. | A security system in a building |
| Administrative Controls | Refers to policies, procedures, and guidelines that define how security is managed and enforced. Examples include security training, background checks, and security audits. | The security policies and procedures of a company or organization. |

### Physical Controls:
- **Badge Systems and Gate Entry**
- **Environmental Design**
- **Biometrics**

### Logical/Technical Controls:
- **Passwords**
- **Biometrics (implemented on a system, such as a smartphone or laptop)**
- **Badge/token readers connected to a system**

| Concept | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discretionary Access Control (DAC) | A type of access control where the owner of a resource decides who is allowed to access that resource. | An example of DAC in real life could be a person owning a private Instagram account and deciding who is allowed to follow them and see their posts. |
| Mandatory Access Control (MAC) | A type of access control where access to a resource is determined by the system rather than the owner. | An example of MAC in real life could be a government agency using a classified computer system where access is based on a set of rules that define who is allowed to access the system and the level of clearance they have. |
| Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) | A type of access control where access to resources is based on the role a user plays within an organization. | An example of RBAC in real life could be a company using a system where access to certain files and data is restricted based on an employee's job title and responsibilities. For instance, a marketing employee may have access to the company's social media accounts, while a financial employee may have access to the accounting software. |
